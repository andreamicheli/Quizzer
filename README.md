# Quiz Platform Application

### Description

This application (Quizzer) is a quiz platform where users can create and manage custom questionnaires. Users can configure a series of questions with multiple answers, selecting the correct answer for each one. The quiz is stored locally on the device, allowing users to delete questions if desired. Once at least one question is configured, users can start the quiz. The application will guide them through each question, keeping track of their score. Upon completing all questions, users are redirected to a results page displaying their total score. Users can then return to the homepage to edit the questionnaire or start a new quiz.
